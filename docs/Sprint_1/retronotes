1. Things That Went Well
What went well? What the team is happy about?
* I believe what went well is that everyone was able to help contribute to the github and clickup. 
* The workload was distributed equally and agreed upon by everyone.



2. Things That Could Have Gone Better
What could have gone better? What the team could improve?
* Time management was a key issue that our group failed to manage.
* Another issue that our group faced was organisational skills. An example of this is the ability to oraganise schedules in which we should do our tasks. This technially ties with our problem with time management, if we were able to more effectively and efficiently organise ourselves, our time management and organisation will be both solved as a result.
* Another issue our group faced was communication, a key example of this was being unable to effectively communicate with one of our group members, Haonan Jiang. 
* A number of things confused our group in the specifications. More timeshould be prepared ahead of time before our tutes in order for our tutor to answer our questions rather than to rely on our own intepretation of the specification.

3. Things That Surprised Us
What wasnâ€™t expected?
* One of our group member was out of contact for the majority of time for the first assignment, and only joined one of the tutorials. This meant that more of the workload had to be shared on the other group members.


4. Lessons Learned
What you learned from the above points?
* One of the biggest lessons learnt is that in order to suceed and thrive, a team should have more organisational skills as well as develop better time management in order to become an effective team. Without these skills, it is very likely that the group will fall apart without a common goal.


5. Final Thoughts
Things to Keep
* Keeping up the good work 

Things to Change
* Schedule more meetings to allow for more effective communication
